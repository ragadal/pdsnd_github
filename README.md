### Date created
I created this project (Project3) and README file on Feb-27-23

### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I have written a code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I have also written a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

### Files used
I have used three csv files provided by Udacity called,
- Chicago.csv
- New_york_city.csv
- Washington.csv
